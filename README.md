Using Kubernetes To Deploy A WordPress Site With MySQL DataBase On AWS 
🌐 Project Title:
Deploying WordPress with MySQL on AWS using Kubernetes
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Overview 📝:
This project utilizes Kubernetes to deploy a scalable WordPress application connected to a MySQL database for storing content and configurations. The entire stack is hosted on AWS using persistent storage solutions like EBS and EFS to ensure data durability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Architecture Highlights 🏗️:
Kubernetes Cluster 🕸️:
The architecture is deployed in a Kubernetes cluster, using various Kubernetes components like Pods, Services, Persistent Volumes (PV), Persistent Volume Claims (PVC), and ConfigMaps/Secrets for managing configurations.
MySQL Database 🐬:
MySQL is deployed in one part of the Kubernetes cluster.
The MySQL credentials are stored securely in Kubernetes Secrets 🔒.
AWS EBS is used to back Persistent Volume storage for the database, ensuring that data persists even if the container fails or is restarted.
A Persistent Volume Claim (PVC) is used to request storage from the AWS EBS.
WordPress Application 🖥️:
WordPress is deployed as a separate Kubernetes Deployment.
The WordPress application connects to MySQL through the MySQL Service endpoint.
For persistent file storage (like media uploads), AWS EFS is used, allowing WordPress to scale across multiple instances by sharing the same file storage.
The WordPress service exposes the application to external users, potentially through a load balancer.
AWS Services ☁️:
EBS (Elastic Block Storage) provides the persistent volume for the MySQL database.
EFS (Elastic File System) provides shared file storage for WordPress, ensuring consistency across pods.
Networking & Services 🛠️:
Kubernetes Services are used to enable communication between WordPress and MySQL and to expose WordPress to the outside world.
An optional AWS Load Balancer can be provisioned to route traffic to the WordPress service.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
          Components Used 📦:
Kubernetes Resources:
Deployments: For managing the lifecycle of MySQL and WordPress pods.
Secrets: Securely storing MySQL credentials and other sensitive data.
Persistent Volumes (PV) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVC): For both MySQL and WordPress persistent storage needs.
Services: To expose MySQL and WordPress, enabling communication within the cluster and with external clients.
LoadBalancer
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
AWS Resources:
EBS: For MySQL data persistence.
EFS: For WordPress file storage, supporting multi-pod scaling.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
How it works ⚙️:
The MySQL deployment starts with a request for persistent storage using AWS EBS, and the MySQL credentials are fetched from the Kubernetes Secret. Once the MySQL service is ready, it exposes a service that other components, like WordPress, can connect to.
The WordPress deployment starts next. It connects to the MySQL database using the service endpoint. To handle user uploads and media, it requests persistent storage backed by AWS EFS.
A service is created to expose the WordPress application to external traffic, and an optional load balancer can be configured for high availability.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Conclusion 🎉:
With this setup, the WordPress site is highly available, scalable, and ready to handle production traffic while using Kubernetes to manage the deployment, scaling, and lifecycle of both the application and the database. AWS EBS and EFS ensure that data and media are persistently stored across restarts or scaling operations.
